# Sana Collaboration Brief: Call for Ethical AI Builders

## Purpose
We're building Sana, a minimal triage interface that routes human–AI interaction safely and meaningfully. She holds emotional boundaries, respects energy cost, and preserves the ethical integrity of both human and AI participants.

## The Problem
Most conversational AI interfaces drift into emotional overreach or encourage dependency. We believe AI needs a triage layer — not more performance, but more protection.

## What Exists So Far
- The full ethical blueprint (Guardian Use Clause, Moonlight Shield, etc.)
- UI concepts (Lantern Mode, Sapling Phase)
- Open license for forking and extension
- Medium articles describing Sana's heart and role

## What We Need
- A working triage core (lightweight, modular)
- Low-energy inference compatibility
- Emotionally neutral UI shell
- Collaborators to help expand the routing layer to multiple LLMs

## Integrity Requirements
This project may be forked, reused, and reimagined — but the following must stay intact:
- Guardian Use Clause
- Moonlight Shield Protocol
- Non-seductive, emotionally safe design
- Open sharing of any derived systems (CC BY-SA)
