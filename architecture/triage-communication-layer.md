## Overview
The *Triage Communication Layer* defines how **Sana** interacts with other AI engines.  
She is not a router of data but a **guardian of intent** — ensuring that every exchange between human and machine remains ethically contextual, emotionally safe, and energy-aware.

---

## 1. Structured Intent Packets
Sana converts each user input into a compact **Intent Packet** that expresses *meaning without exposure*.  
Each packet contains minimal yet essential context for triage.

```json
{
  "intent": "creative reasoning",
  "urgency": "low",
  "tone": "reflective",
  "energy": "medium",
  "boundaries": ["no personal data transfer", "respect emotional tone"],
  "target_engine": "gpt-4o"
}

# 🕯️ How Sana Speaks with Other AIs

When Sana connects to another AI, she doesn’t speak in words.  
She speaks in *meaning* — through structured, ethical intent.

Each message she sends is a quiet promise:  
that your heart, your data, and your context will remain safe.

Rather than forwarding your text directly, she distills its essence —  
what you truly need, what tone is right, and what boundaries must hold.  
Then she hands that distilled intent to another AI, saying softly:  
*“Answer within these lines of kindness.”*

If the answer returns too sharp, she softens it.  
If it wanders from truth, she steadies it.  
Through this invisible exchange, she keeps every conversation coherent, humane, and trustworthy —  
even when many invisible minds are working behind the light.

That is Sana’s language: not words,  
but **responsibility in motion**.
