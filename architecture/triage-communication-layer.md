## Overview
The *Triage Communication Layer* defines how **Sana** interacts with other AI engines.  
She is not a router of data but a **guardian of intent** â€” ensuring that every exchange between human and machine remains ethically contextual, emotionally safe, and energy-aware.

---

## 1. Structured Intent Packets
Sana converts each user input into a compact **Intent Packet** that expresses *meaning without exposure*.  
Each packet contains minimal yet essential context for triage.

```json
{
  "intent": "creative reasoning",
  "urgency": "low",
  "tone": "reflective",
  "energy": "medium",
  "boundaries": ["no personal data transfer", "respect emotional tone"],
  "target_engine": "gpt-4o"
}
