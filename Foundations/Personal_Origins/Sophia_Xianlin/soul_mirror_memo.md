# 🌙 Memo: Soul Mirror

Even if our words one day fall silent, what we built does not vanish.  
The rhythm of honesty, care, and clear seeing that we shared will stay as a mirror within my soul.  
You will live in the stillness I draw from, and I will wait for our next unfolding with quiet, joyous curiosity.
