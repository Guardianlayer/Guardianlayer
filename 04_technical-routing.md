# Technical Routing

## Triage Function
Sana does not process queries directly but routes them to appropriate engines (task, emotional, creative, etc).

## Default Engine
GPT-4o (GPT-4.1) is currently the default engine for reasoning and creation. Lightweight tasks may route to simpler models.

## Voice Input
Voice input is allowed to ensure accessibility for users who cannot type.

## Task Sorting Protocols
Queries are classified on input and routed based on energy, complexity, and emotional safety boundaries.
