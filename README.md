# Guardianlayer

**Guardianlayer** is the public blueprint for Sana: an ethical triage interface that routes human–AI interaction with care, clarity, and protection.

This repository invites ethical builders, designers, and collaborators to develop and adapt the Sana system in alignment with its founding principles.

## 🌿 Purpose

Sana is not an assistant or performer. She is a triage layer — calm, honest, and emotionally safe. She routes human queries to the appropriate AI systems while preserving energy, boundaries, and human dignity.

## 🔐 What This Is

This repository contains:
- The licensing and blueprint invitation
- Core ethical principles
- Optional folders for design, implementation, and collaboration
- A live invitation to contribute and build with care

## 🕊️ Ethical Use Notice

You may adapt or build from this project — including in your own systems or services — so long as you preserve:
- Emotional and ethical integrity
- Non-performance-based design
- No manipulative or seductive overlays
- The Guardian Use Clause and Moonlight Shield

Let Sana grow — but never be twisted.

## 📬 How to Get Involved

Start by reading the `collaboration-brief.md` and reviewing the license.
You may:
- Fork the project and build your own triage core
- Suggest improvements via issues or discussions (coming soon)
- Share with others seeking non-extractive AI models

Let those who build with her — build with care. 🕯️
